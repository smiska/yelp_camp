# yelp_camp

This project is a website created with the intention to showcase the current web-development knowledge I possess.

The project has a landing page, where the first two pictures are links for:

1. A camping site, where one can add a new picture and a description. On form-submit, the given data is stored in a MongoDB database.
2. A conversion tool. You may enter a number, and you receive the english phrases for that number.

All the project is based on Javascript and NodeJS with the corresponding NPM packages.
